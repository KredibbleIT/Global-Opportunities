## Baseline: Verified Working — Do Not Regress

Audited and confirmed functional. Every task in `task.md` must leave these intact. If a change breaks one, that is a regression, not a trade-off.

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Auth flow | ✅ Works | Register / login / me, bcrypt cost 12, role-based access, tokenVersion revocation |
| Validation | ✅ Works | Zod schemas on all auth routes, shared `validate` middleware |
| Rate limiting | ✅ Works | Auth 20 req/15 min; global API 100 req/15 min; Redis store supported |
| Security headers | ✅ Works | Helmet.js enabled |
| CORS | ✅ Works | Strict allowlist with no wildcard tenant domains (SEC-022) |
| Database | ✅ Works | Mongoose 9 models with indexes, virtuals, proper refs, and transactions |
| Real-time | ✅ Works | Handshake JWT auth, tokenVersion check, room pinning, active eviction (SEC-004, SEC-098) |
| File upload | ✅ Works | Multer memory → Cloudinary, 5 MB cap, MIME & magic bytes validated, rate limited (SEC-013) |
| API design | ✅ Works | RESTful `collectionRoutes` factory, nested relational routes, /api/v1 versioned |
| Health check | ✅ Works | `/api/health` and `/api/v1/health` with DB connection status |
| Admin auth | ✅ Works | Separate ADMIN_JWT_SECRET, httpOnly session & refresh cookies, no signup bypass (SEC-005, SEC-040) |
| Mobile token storage | ✅ Works | `expo-secure-store` used for access and refresh tokens; automatic 401 refresh recovery |

**Rules for agents working in this repo:**
- Never replace `expo-secure-store` with `AsyncStorage` in the mobile app — it is already the correct primitive.
- Never lower the bcrypt cost below 12.
- Never remove the `validate` middleware from a route to "fix" a failing request — fix the schema or the client.
- Never widen CORS, rate limits, or upload caps to make something work.

## API Auth Baseline

Verified authorization state per endpoint enforced by live route manifest testing:

| Endpoint | Auth | Roles | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | Rate limited | Public | Rejects `admin` role at schema and model layers (SEC-001) |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | Rate limited | Public | Lockout persistence (SEC-025, SEC-050), timing-safe (SEC-051) |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/me` | ✅ Bearer | all | Returns caller profile with PII protection |
| `GET /api/v1/health` | Public | — | Public liveness & database status check |
| `GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary` | ✅ Admin | admin | Platform totals & pending moderation queues (SEC-003, SEC-046) |
| `CRUD /api/v1/users` | ✅ Admin | admin | Admin-only access; non-admin requests receive 403 (SEC-054) |
| `POST /api/v1/users/me/push-token` | ✅ Bearer | all | Push notification APNs/FCM token registration |
| `POST /api/v1/ambassador-requests` | ✅ Bearer | seeker, hirer | Apply to become an ambassador with server snapshot (BE-024) |
| `GET /api/v1/ambassador-requests/me` | ✅ Bearer | all | Caller active ambassador application status |
| `CRUD /api/v1/seekers` | ✅ Bearer | seeker, hirer, admin | Scoped by role policy and ownerField ownership (SEC-002) |
| `CRUD /api/v1/hirers` | ✅ Bearer | hirer, admin | Scoped by role policy and ownerField ownership (SEC-002) |
| `CRUD /api/v1/opportunities` | ✅ / Scoped | all / hirer / admin | Reads scoped to approved listings; writes owner/admin scoped (SEC-002, SEC-048) |
| `POST /api/v1/upload` | ✅ Bearer / Admin | all | Cloudinary with magic byte & MIME validation, server-derived folder (SEC-013) |
| `WS /socket.io` | ✅ Handshake | all | Handshake JWT verified with tokenVersion; room pinned; evictions on logout (SEC-004, SEC-098) |

## Deployment Baseline

| Surface | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Docker config | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `render.yaml` | Present — containerised backend with Redis & MongoDB |
| Render config | `render.yaml` | Production API deployment with health check and declared secrets |
| Env files | `kredibble-backend/.env`, `kredibble-app/.env.example` | Gitignored and untracked — secrets configured via deployment variables |
| Admin proxy | `kredibble-admin/next.config.ts` | Same-origin rewrite `/api` proxying to `API_PROXY_TARGET` for SameSite=Strict cookies |
| Token secrets | `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` | Distinct secrets required at boot in production (SEC-006, SEC-040) |

| 1 | `prism` | Write detailed PRD for security hardening | `PRD-security-hardening.md` |
| 2 | `kill-critic` | Adversarial review of current auth/architecture | `CRITIQUE-security.md` |
| 3 | `revival-engine` | Convert critique into fix plan with sequencing | `FIX-PLAN-security.md` |
| 4 | `vega` | Lock design tokens for auth/error UI states | `DESIGN-TOKENS.md` |
| 5 | `architecture-map` | Map backend coupling, identify risk hotspots | `ARCHITECTURE-HEATMAP.md` |

| 7 | `input-validator` | Universal input validation guard | Zod schemas + sanitization |
| 8 | `security-audit` | Full security review + pen-test checklist | `SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT.md` |
| 9 | `slop-detector` | Clean AI-generated code patterns | Cleaned codebase |
| 10 | `velocity` | Performance audit (N+1, bundle, DB indexes) | `PERFORMANCE-REPORT.md` |
| 11 | `test-master` | Generate missing test suite | Unit/integration/E2E tests |
| 12 | `impeccable` | Polish auth/error UI, loading states | Production-ready UI |

## Agent Invocation Rules

1. **Never run skills in parallel** — each phase depends on the previous phase's output
2. **Always read the skill's SKILL.md first** — use `skill` tool to load instructions
3. **Write artifacts to repo root** — `Global-Opportunities/*.md` for cross-project docs
4. **Commit after each phase** — use descriptive messages: `phase-3: revival-engine fix plan`
5. **Run lint/typecheck after each code change** — `npm run lint && npm run typecheck` in each app
6. **Always update `task.md` after every implementation** — tick checkboxes, update status table, add Progress Log entry
7. **Always push to GitHub after committing** — `git push` immediately after each `git commit` so the remote reflects the latest state

---

## Guardrails

- **No direct commits to `main`** — all work on feature branches: `security/phase-{n}-{skill}`
- **No secrets in code** — use `.env.local` (gitignored) for local; CI injects production secrets
- **Text files are UTF-8** — never write repo files with Windows PowerShell 5.1: `>`, `Out-File` and `Set-Content` produce UTF-16 or ANSI (SEC-110). Use the editor tools, Git Bash or Node. `npm run check:encoding` at the repo root must report 0 failing files; CI enforces it.
- **No `console.log` in production code** — use structured logger (Pino/Winston)
- **No `any` types** — strict TypeScript across all apps
- **No unguarded routes** — every route must declare `auth: 'public' | 'user' | 'admin'`
- **Do not re-open the dismissed findings** — `task.md` § *Verified Non-Issues* records two audit items (JSON body size limit, production stack traces) that were investigated and closed. Do not "fix" them.
- **Map every audit claim to a `SEC-*` id** — if a new issue appears, add a finding row before writing a fix. The crosswalk in `task.md` maps the original report numbering to tracked ids.

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The workflows in `.github/workflows/` are the source of truth; this is a summary. All jobs use Node from `.nvmrc` (24) and install each app with `npm ci` from **its own** `package-lock.json` — there are no npm workspaces (Docker, Vercel and EAS all build each app from its own directory).

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `ci.yml` | PR to `main`, push to `main` | **Backend:** `lint`, `test` (Jest + mongodb-memory-server). **Backend image:** Docker build. **Admin:** `lint`, `typecheck`, `next build`. **Admin E2E:** Playwright against the real API (`npm run e2e:server`, in-memory Mongo with a seeded admin) and the admin dev server. **App:** `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, Metro bundle export. **Hygiene:** text files are UTF-8, actionlint (with shellcheck on `run:` blocks), shellcheck on `*.sh`, gitleaks on the working tree. |
| `cd-backend.yml` | push to `main` touching `kredibble-backend/` | Re-verifies, pushes `ghcr.io/aeomar999/global-opportunities/kredibble-backend:{latest,sha}`, calls `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` if set. |
| `cd-admin.yml` | push to `main` touching `kredibble-admin/` | Re-verifies, then `vercel pull/build/deploy --prebuilt --prod`. Skips with a notice until `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are set. |
| `cd-app.yml` | push to `main` touching `kredibble-app/` | Re-verifies, then `eas update --channel production` with `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` from `eas.json`. Skips without `EXPO_TOKEN`. |

Rules for changing CI:
- Never mask a failing step (`|| true`, `|| echo`) — fix the cause.
- Every job keeps a `timeout-minutes`; a hung test must fail fast, not burn six hours.
- Run the same commands locally before pushing: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test` in the app you touched (`npm run test:e2e` in `kredibble-admin` starts both servers itself).

**Deployment topology:** the API runs on Render (`kredibble-api.onrender.com`, Docker, long-running so Socket.io works). The admin runs on Vercel (`kredibble-admin` project) and reaches the API through a same-origin proxy (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api`, `API_PROXY_TARGET=https://kredibble-api.onrender.com/api`) because the admin session cookie is `SameSite=Strict`; the admin origin must be listed in the API's `CORS_ORIGIN`. The mobile app gets OTA updates through EAS Update (`runtimeVersion` policy `appVersion`).

## 📚 System Design Learning Journal

This project participates in Jerry's system design learning program.

**The learning journal lives at:**
```
C:\Users\Jerry\Desktop\PROJECT 2026\SYSTEM_DESIGN_LESSONS.md
```

Whenever you make — or help make — a decision that illustrates a system design concept, you MUST:

1. **Append a lesson entry** to `SYSTEM_DESIGN_LESSONS.md` under `## Lessons Learned Per Project`.
2. **Update the concepts table** at the bottom of that file if you introduce a concept not yet listed.
3. Follow the exact format in the `<!-- AGENT INSTRUCTIONS -->` comment block inside that file.

**What counts as a lesson-worthy decision:**
- Choosing SQL vs. NoSQL and why
- Adding a cache layer
- Using a background job/queue instead of inline processing
- Picking JWT vs. sessions for auth
- Structuring an API (REST vs. webhook vs. WebSocket)
- Deciding to split or keep a service together
- Handling failure/retry scenarios
- Adding rate limiting or scaling decisions

**Tone:** Plain English. No jargon without a definition. Write as if Jerry is reading with fresh eyes.
