/**
 * Permissions: a matrix of screen -> role -> "edit" | "view". A missing entry means no access.
 *
 * DEFAULTS (change them here; they are easy to find because each role is one line below)
 * - Every role: edit My scorecard and Settings (the personal part), and view the Overview. Overview, My scorecard
 *   and Settings are therefore reachable by everyone.
 * - super_admin and desk_lead: edit everything except the Team scorecard, which they can only view.
 * - moderator: edit verification, reports queue, opportunities queue, channels, seekers, hirers (suspend).
 * - support: edit seekers and hirers (suspend only).
 * - partnerships_officer: edit partners; view network, leaderboard.
 * - opportunities_officer: edit opportunities queue, career resources; view events, grants.
 * - training_officer: edit programs, events; view network.
 * - database_officer: edit database; view network.
 * - communications_officer: edit testimonials, notifications, career resources; view monthly report, social.
 * - social_media_manager: edit social; view testimonials (the quotes they can share).
 * - country_lead: edit network; view programs, partners, database, leaderboard.
 * - admin_support: edit team (members).
 * - roles_permissions (the Roles & permissions tab on Team): edit for super_admin, view for desk_lead, nobody else.
 *   The Members tab keeps "team".
 * - settings_admin (Settings > Targets, Pipeline stages, Integrations): edit for super_admin and desk_lead only.
 *   "settings" stays the key for the personal "My account" part, which every role has.
 * - ambassadors.export and ambassadors.import (download or upload ambassador data in bulk, on the Network page): edit for
 *   super_admin and desk_lead only (they get every screen). No other role has them. Give them to country_lead later if wanted.
 * - accounts.create (Create account on Team > Members, and the account actions on its rows: resend invite, change role, deactivate,
 *   reactivate): SUPER ADMIN ONLY. desk_lead gets every screen through everything(), so it is removed for them below.
 * - listings_curate (creating and editing curated listings): edit for opportunities_officer, desk_lead, super_admin.
 *   "opportunities_queue" stays the key for moderating listings that hirers submit.
 * - monthly_report: also view for partnerships_officer (the partner version only; the team version is gated by
 *   team_scorecard).
 * MODERATOR and SUPPORT are different: their rows are COMPUTED at runtime from the saved toggles on Team > Roles &
 * permissions (see editableRoleGrants and TOGGLE_GRANTS in lib/role-permissions.ts). The other ten rows are fixed here.
 * A user with two roles gets the HIGHEST level of either (see accessLevel).
