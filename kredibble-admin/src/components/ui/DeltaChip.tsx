/**
 * DeltaChip: small "change" pill, e.g. "+12%".
 *
 * Colour follows whether the change is GOOD, not which way the arrow points:
 * - moving in `goodDirection` -> success (green)
 * - moving the other way      -> warning (amber)
 * The arrow always shows the real direction, and the value text is always
 * shown, so colour is never the only signal. Screen readers also get
 * "improved" / "worsened".
 *
 * Props:
 * - label: the text, e.g. "-8%" or "+2"
 * - direction: real direction of the change ("up" | "down")
 * - goodDirection: which direction is an improvement for this metric
 * - children: optional extra text inside the chip (e.g. "vs previous 7 days")
