/**
 * Scorecard data service: what the Scorecard screen (/scorecard) shows. The maths is in lib/scorecard.ts; this file only loads, with the
 * delay, the dev states and the real-API case the other services have.
 *
 * - getMyScorecard(roles, month): the VIEWER's scorecard. It is worked out from the roles passed in (the viewer's current roles from the
 *   role context, so the dev switcher works) and carries nothing about anyone else: no other name, no team list.
 * - getTeamScorecard(month): every person in the staff collection, ranked. Only the Team tab calls it, and only for roles that may view it.
 * - Mock mode: worked out from the shared in-memory store with the same functions as the Overview, so a card, a priority and a scorecard
 *   row always agree. The first load takes a moment (skeletons); later ones are instant.
 * - Dev only: ?state=loading|error|empty on the page URL forces that state (mock mode, never in production).
 * - Real-API mode: the figures come from the live scorecard API (BE-015); `notConnected` is false once it answers.
