/**
 * Data loader for the Verification queue list page (the Opportunities queue's is in opportunities.ts).
 *
 * They follow the same switch as the Overview (see mock-mode.ts):
 * - Mock mode (NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=true, or unset in development): realistic mock rows after
 *   ~400ms. They come from the same mock records the detail page uses, so every row link opens a
 *   real detail page. Together the rows cover every status the page can show (pending,
 *   approved, rejected).
 * - Real mode: GET /admin/verification/companies (existing helper in lib/api.ts).
 *   Errors reject with the server's message, and the page shows them inline with a retry button.
 *
 * Each loader returns ALL rows once; the pages filter and count on the client, so a filter change
 * never triggers a request.
