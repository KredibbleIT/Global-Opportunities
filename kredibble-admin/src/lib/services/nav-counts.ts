 * Counts for the sidebar pills and rail dots.

 * - Mock mode: fixed demo values (see mock-mode.ts).
 * - Real mode: the existing GET /dashboard/summary response.
 *
 * A count that is unknown (request failed, field missing) is simply absent
 * from the result, so the UI hides the pill instead of showing 0. The
 * in-flight request is shared, so several callers cause one round trip.
