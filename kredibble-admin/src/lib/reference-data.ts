/**
 * Reference data: the dropdown lists the mobile app shows, grouped the way the admin edits them.
 *
 * Seeker lists are seeded from kredibble-app/src/app/(auth)/signup.tsx, hirer lists from the same
 * file, and grants lists from kredibble-app/src/app/grants/filter.tsx. In the app they are hardcoded
 * arrays, so today they can only change with a code deploy; the admin edits an in-memory copy.
 *
 * Every list has an explicit `singular` ("university") used in the add field's placeholder, so the
 * wording never comes from chopping an "s" off the plural ("universitie").
