/**
 * THE one place that maps every status string used across the admin to a
 * visual tone and a label. StatusBadge reads this, so a status looks the same
 * on every list, detail page and card. Status is always shown as colour AND
 * text (a dot or icon plus the label).
 *
 *   success  Active, Verified, Published, Approved, Upcoming, Open (opportunities, grants)
 *   warning  Pending, Flagged, Open (reports), In review
 *   danger   Rejected, Suspended, Removed, Cancelled
 *   neutral  Draft, Past, Closed, Resolved, Dismissed, Not submitted, Planned, Applicant, Unpublished
 *   info     Running (a program), Onboarding (an ambassador): in progress, nothing wrong, nothing finished (purple)
 *
 * Desk statuses (programs, ambassadors, testimonials, listings):
 *   partner      prospect = neutral, outreach / proposal / mou = info (in progress), onboard / renew = success (closed)
 *   program      planned = neutral, running = info, delivered = success, cancelled = danger
 *   ambassador   applicant = neutral, onboarding = info, active = success, dormant = warning
 *   database     verified = success, pending = warning
 *   testimonial  pending = warning, approved = success, unpublished = neutral, rejected = danger
 *   listing      draft = neutral, published = success
 *   vetting      unvetted = warning, vetted = success
 *   pipeline     healthy = success, thin = warning, critical = danger, unknown ("Not enough data") = neutral
 *   pace         on_pace = success, behind = warning, far_behind = danger (the Database verification pace, from kpiStatus). They read
 *                "On track / Behind / Off track" (KPI_STATUS_LABELS): the gauge ZONES have their own words.
 *
 * "Open" is the one word that means two things: an open opportunity or grant is
 * good (success) but an open REPORT is waiting on a person (warning). Pass
 * kind="report" for reports; everything else uses the default.
 *
 * Unknown values fall back to "neutral" and display their raw text.
