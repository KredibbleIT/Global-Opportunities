/**
 * Types for the desk's entities. They stay SEPARATE in the data model and in the UI:
 *
 * - Listing         a curated Opportunity: a public listing, gated by vetting (not the same as a Program)
 * - Program         one of GOD's own activities (a training, a cohort, a campaign)
 * - Partner         an organisation in the six-stage pipeline, with the history of its stage changes
 * - Ambassador      someone who amplifies listings with a referral code (the Network)
 * - DatabaseRecord  a beneficiary kept in the desk's database
 * - SocialPost, Testimonial, MonthlyReport   the desk's content
 * - StaffMember     the people behind the roles: ONE collection read by the Team page, the invite form, the member
 *                   page and the scorecards
 * - Target          a monthly goal for one KPI (the Settings screen will edit them)
 *
 * Dates are ISO strings ("2026-10-03" or a full ISO time). Every foreign key (partnerId, ambassadorId, listingId,
 * authorId...) points at an id that exists in the seed; src/lib/mock-seed.ts builds the data and the tests check
 * the links. The shared mock store (mock-store.ts) holds one collection per type.
